# SpringCrud
Spring Backend application

Creating a README file for your Spring Boot CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application is important for
documentation and sharing information about your project. Below is an example README file that you can use as a
template. You can customize it to fit the specific details of your application:

# Spring Boot CRUD Application

This is a simple Spring Boot application that demonstrates basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a
database. It serves as a starting point for building more complex Spring Boot applications.

- A database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) with the necessary schema setup.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-boot-crud-application.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd spring-boot-crud-application

Update application.properties or application.yml with your database configuration.

Build the project:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean package
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
java -jar target/spring-boot-crud-application.jar

The application should be up and running on http://localhost:8080.
